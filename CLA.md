## FAQ

### What is the rationale for this Contributor License Agreement (CLA)?

The Affero GNU Public License is perhaps the strongest copyleft license published by the Free Software Foundation. It activates the requirement that source code be made available to users even in the case of running the software to serve users over a network. In contrast, the regular GNU Public License (GPL) technically does not require the source to be published if the server software isn't distributed. Therefore, the AGPL is the best license for this project as a whole. However, this means that AGPL-licensed code cannot be freely mixed with GPL-licensed code without making the entire project AGPL-licensed, therefore causing headaches for GPL-licensed projects, or people that would generally find the code to be useful but who can't make their project GPL-licensed. With this Contributor License Agreement, the maintainers have the ability to fork off a portion of the code and publish it under the GPL, LGPL, or a permissive license.

### Will this allow making the project closed source?

No. This CLA specifically enumerates the licenses that are acceptable for relicensing. The project maintainers do not have the ability to make the project closed source. However, they do have the ability to make the project non-copyleft/permissively licensed.
