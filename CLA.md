## FAQ

### What is the rationale for this Contributor License Agreement (CLA)?

The Affero GNU Public License is perhaps the strongest copyleft license published by the Free Software Foundation. It activates the requirement that source code be made available to users even in the case of running the software to serve users over a network. In contrast, the regular GNU Public License (GPL) technically does not require the source to be published if the server software isn't distributed. Therefore, the AGPL is the best license for this project as a whole. However, this means that AGPL-licensed code cannot be freely mixed with GPL-licensed code without making the entire project AGPL-licensed, therefore causing headaches for GPL-licensed projects. With this Contributor License Agreement, the maintainers have the ability to fork off a portion of the code under the GPL or LGPL.

### Will this allow making the project closed source?

No. This CLA specifically enumerates the licenses that are acceptable for relicensing. We do not have the ability to make the project closed source, or to loosen the license past the LGPL.

### Can I still make money off running an instance of this software?

There is no restriction on using this software to make money, only that you publish your modified version of the source code so that improvements can potentially be incorporated into the main project. Value-creation and competitive advantage are derived from operating the service, and not having sole access to the source code. For-profit companies exist that are based on selling open source software. However, we can't answer the question of whether you will break even on server costs for you.

### What shows can I serve using this software?

This software is a generic tool, not specific to any particular TV show or other creative work, and the only innate limitations are technical ones. We, the providers of the software, do not control what you use it for, and what content you serve. This is strictly your (the site operator's) responsibility.
